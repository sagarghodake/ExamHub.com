					<h5>Sucess Stories :</h5>


					<p style="text-align: justify;">James A. Gosling, O.C., Ph.D.
						(born May 19, 1955 near Calgary, Alberta, Canada) is a famous
						software developer, best known as the father of the Java
						programming language. The story of James Gosling and Java is a
						classic tale of disruptive discovery in the new economy. It began
						in the early 1990s while Gosling was a lead engineer for Sun
						Microsystems, the networked computing pioneer that was about to
						make its debut on the Fortune 500. Gosling began working on a
						secret task force called “The Green Project” to investigate and
						address future issues for Sun as new technologies like the
						Internet were coming of age. As the project developed, it became
						obvious that one of those issues was the programming language, and
						the absence of a universal software platform. Gosling’s assignment
						was to solve this problem, and his solution was Java. Gosling’s
						personal creation, Java made the construction of networked
						applications easy and reliable, enabling a new breed of
						universally accessible, cross-platform Internet applications.
						Gosling realized his success at a 1995 event to launch a number of
						new Sun products. Customer attention became focused on Java,
						entirely shifting the agenda for the event. The positive response
						and acceptance was overwhelming, making it a proud moment for
						Gosling — he had made it. From a young age, Gosling has been very
						involved with technology. In high school, he often skipped classes
						to sneak off and work in the university computer lab. By 15 he was
						analyzing ISIS satellite data for the physics department at the
						University of Calgary. In 1977, he received his Computer Science
						degree from the University of Calgary, and in 1983 he received his
						PhD from Carnegie-Mellon before spending a brief time at IBM
						research. Today virtually every Internet-enabled application is
						based in some way on Java, and Gosling continues to promote and
						build on his already landmark contribution to the new economy.</p>
