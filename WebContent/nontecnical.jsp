							<h4 class="card-title">Interview Questions & Answers</h4>
							<p>
								<b>1. Tell me about yourself.</b>
							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">The FIRST &amp; BEST question for any HR
								interview. The answer to this basically sets the tone of rest of
								the interview.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">Give a brief of your education background
										(up to plus two is fine, your family and location, any of your
										hobbies etc.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">You can also mention one of your major
										achievements, if it fits the circumstance.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">Keep the answer to just about 3-4 sentences
										and not more than that.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">No need to explain your strengths &amp;
										weakness at this points (as that will definitely come along).
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">A common mistake seen is most HR interview
										is to start the sentence like "I am basically from..." No need
										to start a sentence like that.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">Keep the answer simple, to the point and
										give space and time for further questions. Do not stretch it
										too much.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<strong>Example:</strong>
							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<strong>"</strong><strong>First of all, many thanks for
									calling me and giving me this golden opportunity to introduce
									myself in front of you.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Hi I
									am Kiran and hails from Bangalore. I did my B.Tech in
									electronics and communication from Rameswara College of
									engineering, which is under Bangalore University. I had
									completed my plus two from Chinmaya Vidhya Mission School and
									secured 98% in CBSE Boards. I have four members in my family
									and I am the youngest son. I love outdoor sports, specifically
									athletics and was a member of college athletic team."</strong>
							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<strong><br></strong>
							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<b>2. What are your key strengths ?</b>
							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">This is another most common question in any
								HR interview. The idea here is to understand how much you know
								about yourself and how confident you are about your strengths.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">Just stay positive. Even a simple answer
										like "I am a very positive person" is good&nbsp;enough.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">You can also change this as per the
										requirement of the interview. Knowing a bit about&nbsp;the
										profile you are being interviewed helps as well.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">Explaining your strength with an experience
										from the past is desirable here.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<strong>Example:</strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">"Sir, my greatest strength is my ability to
										learn things quickly. For example, I had to represent my
										college in an inter college science exhibition, and was
										introduced to the team at the very last minute. I was able to
										understand our exhibits and artifacts and present them with
										great success".</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">"I think my greatest strength is my
										positive attitude, even during the&nbsp;most hardest of times.
										During my college project, there has been couple&nbsp;of
										occasions, when our idea was not falling in place and the
										results were&nbsp;negative. I had to believe and think
										positively and keep my team motivated to&nbsp;persist on our
										idea, and finally we got the desired result."</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">"My best skill would be my verbal ability
										and articulation skill. I have worked as editor for our
										college magazine and have been involved with various literary
										forums during my school and college days.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<br>

							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<b>3. What is one thing, which you want to improve about
									yourself ? (OR) what are your weaknesses ?</b>
							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								This is a trick question. The expectation here is to answer a
								negative trait with a positive twist. Something which in general
								a weak point of a person, but is alright from an organization
								perspective.<br>
							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<strong>Example</strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">"I tend to try to take up too many things,
										leaving little time for myself."</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">"I am a perfectionist and sometimes,
										concentrate too much on one single task to get it to
										perfection, using up time from other tasks".</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">"I tend to say Yes, when someone asks for
										help. I am working on learning to say No at times".</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<br>

							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<b>4. Who is the most inspiring person in your life</b>
							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">The important part is not who, but
								why?&nbsp;When you answer this question with a name, you should
								follow it up with why he / she&nbsp;is most inspiring person.</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<strong>Example</strong>:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">"My greatest inspiration is Sachin
										Tendulkar. He had such a humble upbringing&nbsp;&amp; his hard
										work took him to the greatest heights in the world of sports.
										He&nbsp;still keeps himself rooted and stays humble. I also
										believe in hard work and&nbsp;humility".</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">"My greatest inspiration is my dad. He has
										always thought me to not worry&nbsp;about my weakness and take
										most advantage of my strengths. This has&nbsp;developed a lot
										of confidence in me during difficult times."</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<b>5. Where do you see yourself in 5 years from now ?</b>
							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">This is a question intended to know, what are
								your career aspirations, how long would you be committed to the
								organization, is there any immediate plans for you to move
								on&nbsp;etc.&nbsp;If you have an actual plan, explain it with
								reasoning. If you do not have any specific&nbsp;plans as of
								then, give a generic answer along with some interesting activity
								you would&nbsp;like to take up.</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<strong>Example</strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">"I would like to see myself donning one of
										the senior positions in the&nbsp;organization contributing to
										technology as well as participating in business&nbsp;growth. I
										am hoping, I can position myself with relevant experience by
										then."</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">"As a fresher, I am assuming by first five
										years will be a huge learning curve.&nbsp;I want to absorb
										much of the industry knowledge and also to sharpen
										my&nbsp;technical abilities. In next five years I see myself
										playing various roles in the&nbsp;team from a developer to
										leading a team."</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">"I would like to see myself as a technical
										architect in next five years. My core&nbsp;competency is with
										technologies, and I would like to work and contribute in
										the&nbsp;field of most recent technologies and advancements. I
										would like to get take&nbsp;up some of the major technology
										certifications"</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<br>

							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<b>6. Have you been in some challenging situation ? Explain
									how you handled it ?</b>
							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">This is usually an add-on question to explain
								your strengths that you mention&nbsp;previously.&nbsp;This is
								good opportunity to give a suitable example, as to why you
								mentioned what your&nbsp;strengths are.</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<strong>Example:</strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">"Yes, we did have some challenging
										situation during our final semester project&nbsp;delivery.
										Usually the kind of code logic we were trying to implemented,
										works&nbsp;with a 64bit processor, while we were trying to
										make it work with a lower&nbsp;configuration, due to budgetary
										constraints". Theoretically it was possible, but&nbsp;result
										was not coming through and the team wanted to give up and
										upgrade the&nbsp;hardware. I was positive, that this will work
										and that we stick to the plan and&nbsp;figure out our actual
										problem. It took some effort to convince my team, a
										lot&nbsp;more hard work and few extra hours of reading, but
										finally we stayed positive&nbsp;and cracked the issue and
										delivered the project.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<p lang="en-IN">
												<strong>The above example, explains your strength
													like Positive thinking, hard&nbsp;work etc.</strong>

											</p>
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">"I have a huge passion for sports and have
										been a regular member of college&nbsp;athletic team. There was
										an event coming up slightly ahead of one of our
										exam&nbsp;schedule. Although our coach said, I can &nbsp;skip
										the competition, I was sure I can&nbsp;win points for the
										college. So I decided, I will put in extra time in studies
										late&nbsp;evenings, while also practicing and attending the
										event. I had to stretch a bit&nbsp;physically &amp; mentally,
										and also manage my time tightly. But finally I was
										able&nbsp;to win the tournament and also come out with good
										scores in exam.&nbsp;</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<p lang="en-IN">
												<strong>The above showcases, you multitasking
													capability, time management,&nbsp;passion for things and
													hard work.</strong>

											</p>
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<br>

							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<b>7. Why should we hire you ?&nbsp;</b>
							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">As a fresher, you can’t commit to any
								expertise in any specific domain. So this question&nbsp;is
								intended to understand what quality of yours will be helpful
								most for the company. Knowledge about company and what quality
								of yours suits the organization, is the key&nbsp;to answer this.
								In case you don’t know much about the company, quick learning
								ability, flexibility,&nbsp;team player etc are few common
								qualities that will fit any organizational needs.</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<strong>Example:</strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">"I have had some internships and industry
										exposure. So being a fresher, it will&nbsp;still be easy for
										me adapt to the new environment, which is significantly
										lessen&nbsp;my training cost."</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">"I have a sharp learning curve, which will
										help company ramp me up quickly&nbsp;as a productive resource.
										An example of my learning curve is my final year&nbsp;project,
										where I have worked on a short time frame on an entirely
										new&nbsp;technology"</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">"I am a strong team player a good leader. I
										have been leading teams for&nbsp;technical and cultural
										activities during my college days. In your company I
										will&nbsp;be a great player within any challenging team and
										provide leadership when&nbsp;opportunity arises"</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<br>

							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<b>8. Are you willing to change your role and profile when
									required for project?</b>
							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">As a fresher, your most sought after quality
								is flexibility. You need to showcase, you&nbsp;are flexible and
								ready to learn.&nbsp;Saying you are flexible doesn’t necessarily
								mean, you will be forced into things, you&nbsp;don’t like. It
								just shows your positive attitude to learn and try new things.</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<strong>Example:</strong>
							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">"Yes, most definitely sir. As a fresher, I
								hope and wish to learn as much things&nbsp;as possible. I
								believe taking up different roles and profiles only helps me
								learn and grow in this industry"</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<br>
							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<b>9. Are you ready to relocate</b>
							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								As long as you do not have any compelling reasons, being a
								fresher it is better to be&nbsp;ready for
								relocation.&nbsp;Today’s IT industry works on global operation
								model, where they have offices&nbsp;located at several
								locations. These are staffed strategically, as per need and
								business&nbsp;requirement and there could be a need for your
								skills at a particular location.<br> Being flexible enough
								to suit the staffing need of a company is a great advantage
								for&nbsp;a fresher and since most of fresher move around with
								less baggage (example: being&nbsp;single), it is easier for
								company to move them at short notice.&nbsp;Remember, this
								applies for a foreign country placement also. So denying a
								relocation&nbsp;means, you are also saying "No" to an onsite
								opportunity as well.
							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<strong>Example:</strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">"Yes, most definitely. I believe being at
										different locations helps me learn&nbsp;about new culture and
										people."</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">"Yes, I don’t see a problem in relocation.
										It’s always a better learning&nbsp;experience than being
										around with same environment and people"</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<br>

							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<b>10. Are you flexible with timings (if have to work in
									shift) ?&nbsp;</b>
							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">This question yet again checks about your
								flexibility.&nbsp;The same answer above applies here.&nbsp;If
								there is a genuine problem for you to work in night or early
								morning shifts, mention&nbsp;that.</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<br>
							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<b>11. Do you wish to pursue higher education?</b>
							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">If you are seriously considering higher
								education, it’s wise to say so.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">If you are unsure (may be – May not be),
										your answers could be –</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<p lang="en-IN">"I am interested in higher studies, but
												not immediately. I want to get started&nbsp;working and then
												look for higher education based on my experience and
												career&nbsp;progressions."</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p lang="en-IN">"Yes, but not immediately. I plan to take
												up part time studies, with either&nbsp;an MBA or an VLSI
												engineering masters, depending on which will be
												more&nbsp;beneficial for my line of work."</p>
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">&nbsp;Some companies support and provide
										various incentives for part time, full time&nbsp;studies. If
										you already know of any such programs, it will be good to
										align your answer&nbsp;according to that.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<b>12. Interview Questions on about Company</b>
							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">In today’s world, with so much information
								available online and through various sources, it is a
								grave&nbsp;mistake to not read up about the company, you are
								attending the interview for. A good knowledge&nbsp;about the
								company during the interview shows your genuine interest in
								getting placed.&nbsp;Few basic things that you need to look up
								about a company are</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">Domain expertise of the company</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">Various industries they cater to</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">Few niceties about being employed at that
										company (Eg: Best employer award by Times&nbsp;magazine)</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">Locations they operate from and main
										business geographies.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">Company history, its current leaders</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">General working culture</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">Any subsidiaries or affiliated companies</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<b><br></b>
							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<b>13. Why do you want to work for us?</b>
							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">Mention some good word about the company at
								the same time, try to align a strength&nbsp;of yours with the
								company vision or goal or working culture.</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<strong>Example</strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">"Working for an organization, which has won
										best employer award multiple&nbsp;times, in itself is a
										motivating factor. But more importantly, I would like
										to&nbsp;start off my career at a place, which values ethical
										practices and encourages&nbsp;overall development of a
										person."</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">"I have always admired XYZ (company), for
										the cutting edge products and&nbsp;developments it bring about
										in the modern world. The impact of our work,&nbsp;is directly
										reflected among the society in general, which is a great
										feeling. I&nbsp;would like to be a part of this modern day
										game changer bandwagon.&nbsp;</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<p lang="en-IN">
												<strong>Note the clever &amp; subtle use of "our"
													work instead of "your" work. You&nbsp;already seems to be a
													part of company.</strong>

											</p>
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">"I believe, life is always a mix of hard
										work and fun. I find the work culture of&nbsp;xyz to carry the
										same principle. "Work hard... Party harder". What better
										way&nbsp;to start off my career, than at a place, where I will
										feel like home."</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<b>14. What is one thing that you like about our company?</b>
							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">Again, always know about the company before
								choosing your answer. A wrong line&nbsp;of answer could cost you
								the job itself. Like you go to a research Organization &amp;
								tell&nbsp;about your partying habit, you most likely lose the
								chance to get through.&nbsp;Most likely one of the above answers
								applies here also. The difference is, you don’t&nbsp;have to
								align this with your interests &amp; strengths.</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<br>

							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<b>15. What are your expectations from your first job?</b>
							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">You can always quote a simple vision or
								strategy which you like about the company.&nbsp;As a fresher,
								your most important expectation should be "To Learn" &amp; this
								is what most&nbsp;companies expect from you.&nbsp;There could be
								additional personal expectation like contributing to society,
								placing&nbsp;yourself within corporate world, paying off your
								education loan etc;</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<strong>Examples</strong>:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">"I have had lot of studies during all these
										years, but mostly theoretical&nbsp;leanings. My first &amp;
										foremost expectation from my first job would be to
										learn&nbsp;how all these are applied in a practical and
										industrial way. I also want to be a&nbsp;part of the corporate
										culture and learn how this is run."</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">
										"I consider my first job as an extension of my studies only.
										More like a practical&nbsp;class. I want to learn a lot of new
										technologies, learn how the corporate world&nbsp;works, be
										part of a big energetic team and contribute to the projects,
										develop&nbsp;my <span lang="zxx"><u><a
												href="http://a4academics.com/soft-skills" target="_blank">soft
													skills</a></u></span> and to prepare myself for tougher challenges in
										future."
									</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<br>

							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<b>16. Do you want to ask us anything&nbsp;</b>
							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION!!&nbsp;Never ever, go
								into an interview without preparing to ask any
								question.&nbsp;Always keep a question handy. This is your
								opportunity to voice any of your concern&nbsp;regarding the job
								profile, company profile, location, timing etc; if not already
								covered.&nbsp;If you really do not have any questions, ask some
								general questions like does company&nbsp;provide any higher
								education opportunity, does company encourage corporate
								social&nbsp;activities. Etc;</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<br>

							</p>
							<p lang="en-IN">
								<b>NOTE :- </b>
							</p>
							<h3 lang="en-IN">
								<b>Avoid</b>
							</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">
										<b>Shabby and casual dressing </b>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">
										<b>Reaching late for interview </b>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">
										<b>Lies and false facts </b>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">
										<b>Stretching your answers beyond required time </b>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p lang="en-IN">
										<b>Arguments or debates </b>
									</p>
								</li>
