						<b>James A. Gosling, O.C., Ph.D. (born May 19, 1955 near
							Calgary, Alberta, Canada)</b> is a famous software developer, best
						known as the father of the Java programming language. The story of
						James Gosling and Java is a classic tale of disruptive discovery
						in the new economy. It began in the early 1990s while Gosling was
						a lead engineer for Sun Microsystems, the networked computing
						pioneer that was about to make its debut on the Fortune 500.
						Gosling began working on a secret task force called The Green
						Project to investigate and address future issues for Sun as new

						<b>Steve Jobs</b> has been known as an iconic figure for the
						establishment of Apple like the biggest company. However, it is
						extremely shocking to know that the $2 billion company with over
						4000 employees has been started with only two persons in a garage.
						It is also to be noticed that this great establisher has been
						dismissed and fired from the company from which he has started his
						career. Further, realizing his potential and capabilities, Steve
						Jobs proceeded further towards establishing this biggest company
						which is famously known as Apple.<br>

						<b>Bill Gates : </b>It was very much important for Bill
						gates to heed the lessons of failure in comparison to celebrating
						the joy of success. This great entrepreneur who has established
						Microsoft like the biggest software company is a dropout student
						from Harvard. Furthermore, he has also been known for his
						self-owned business figure known as Traf-O-Data which was one of
						the biggest failures in history. The entire investment of Bill
						Gates got vanished and unfortunately, even the education could
						also not get completed. But, the keen desire and the passion for
						the computer programming based stuff led him to establish such
						biggest software company with the brand name Microsoft.<br>

						<b>Ratan Tata</b> ,What are you supposed to do when you have a
						 good example to turn upward to and afterward, 
						you are requested to fill the good example's shoes? At the point when 
						Ratan Tata turned into the director in 1991, he had a mammoth undertaking set before him. 
						His modern perspectives and liberal state of mind did not run well with 
						a portion of the best honchos at Tata which brought about a tussle at the administration level. 
						At the simple beginning of his profession as director,
						 two organizations under him confronted bankruptcy and his representatives
						confidence in him dwindled as he cut down the retirement age by 5 years, 
						prompting an ouster of a portion of the most seasoned workers of the association.<br>
